## Git, GitHub

*What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?*

Below is the URL of the Github repo that I created in my personal account. I have also made my new repository publicly available so that it can be accessible to everyone.

### Github URL
https://github.com/maazhasnainkhan/CS625-HW1.git
   
*In which direction does the 'pull' command work (send local changes to remote OR send remote changes to local)?*

The 'pull' command send remote changes to local. I created a file2.txt in my personal account repository and made changes to it remotely and pulled that change to my local machine. This way I got to know about this command in a more practical way.
   
*If you have committed a change on your local machine, but do not see the update on GitHub.com, what step might have you forgotten?*

Although I committed a change and then push it live in my remote personal account repository and then checked updates on Github.com and it went through. What I believe is if only I commit and forgot to push the code, that commit will only be available locally and I could not see that change on Github.com.

*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*

When we removed the outer parentheses from the code, the program throwed an exception related to the parentheses. This is because the parentheses are required to be balanced for a program to run smoothly. The error given is mentioned below:
`SyntaxError: incomplete input`

When we replace the `markCircle()` with `markSquare()` the plot chart using circle points was replaced with square points.
